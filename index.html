        <h2> DRAWING STEPS: ILLUSTRATED INSTRUCTIONS </h2>
        <p> For this survey question, we would like you to draw a shape on a map of Springfield to show where your group works in the Springfield area and the specific boundaries of the area you steward. This drawing tool only allows one Area to be identified,
            so please be as broad in your area as possible. </p>

        <br>
        <p>To begin, make the map larger by clicking the expand icon on the left side of the window </p>

        <br>
        <p>First, find your stewarded area on the map and then you’ll draw a shape over it to show us the boundaries of the areas where you work. To draw your area on the map, you can either move the map by clicking and dragging on the map or type in and
            select an address at the search bar in the top of the window. </p>

        <br>
        <p>Next, you’ll want to place the entire area you steward within your map by zooming in or out. You can do this by scrolling in and out on your mouse, or by clicking the plus and minus signs in the top left corner of the window. </p>

        <br>
        <p>Once you’ve got your stewardship area framed in the map, you will draw a shape around its boundaries. Begin by selecting the drawing tool in the top left corner of the window </p>
